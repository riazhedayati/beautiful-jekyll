Hi, I'm Riaz. I use data to answer questions and find interesting insights.

I'm currently an Advanced Analytical Consultant at [UNC Healthcare](https://www.unchealthcare.org), where I use data to improve patient outcomes and make our hospital system more efficient. 

Previously, I worked at LSU's [Economics & Policy Research Group](https://business.lsu.edu/Economics-and-Policy-Research-Group/Pages/Economics-and-Policy-Research-Group.aspx), where I built forecasts and predictive models for various state agencies. I was a Research Manager at a boutique food/restaurant market research firm called [BrandIQ](http://www.brandiq.biz/) in Los Angeles. I was also a Systems Engineer at [SAS](http://www.sas.com/en_us/home.html), where I helped financial institutions figure out how they can better understand their data and leverage it to make smarter decisions.

I have an MS in Analytics from NC State's [Institute for Advanced Analytics](http://analytics.ncsu.edu), and a BA in Economics from the [University of Arizona](http://www.arizona.edu).

If you'd like to get in contact with me, please email me or message me on LinkedIn. Thanks!

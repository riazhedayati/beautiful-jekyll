Hi, I'm Riaz. I love using data to make predictions.

I'm currently a Systems Engineer at [SAS](http://www.sas.com/en_us/home.html). I help financial institutions figure out how they can better understand their data and leverage it to make smarter decisions.

Previously, I worked at LSU's [Economics & Policy Research Group](https://business.lsu.edu/Economics-and-Policy-Research-Group/Pages/Economics-and-Policy-Research-Group.aspx), where I built predictive models for various state agencies. I was a Research Manager at a boutique market research firm called [BrandIQ](http://www.brandiq.biz/) in Los Angeles. I also taught English to middle schoolers in [Talavera de la Reina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talavera_de_la_Reina), Spain for a while.

I have an MS in Analytics from NC State's [Institute for Advanced Analytics](http://analytics.ncsu.edu), and a BA in Economics from the [University of Arizona](http://www.arizona.edu).

If you'd like to get in contact with me, please email me or message me on LinkedIn. Thanks!

I'm currently working as a Systems Engineer at SAS. I help mid-size banks and credit unions understand how SAS software can help them better understand their data and leverage it to make smarter business decisions.

Before SAS, I worked at LSU's Public Policy Research Group, where I built predictive models for various state agencies. I also worked at a boutique market research firm called BrandIQ in Los Angeles, where I helped create market research surveys, analyzed the results, and presented the findings, primarily to food and restaurant clients. I also spent a year teaching english in Talavera de la Reina, Spain.

I have Masters in Analytics from North Carolina State's [Institute for Advanced Analytics](http://analytics.ncsu.edu), and a bachelors in Economics from the [University of Arizona](http://www.arizona.edu).

If you'd like to get in contact with me, please email me or message me on Linkedin. Thanks!
